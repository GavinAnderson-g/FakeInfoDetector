## FakeInfoDetector
I’m creating a powerful Python script designed to cut through online noise and misinformation by intelligently verifying the truth behind user-submitted claims using real-time web analysis—pushing the boundaries of what a school project can achieve.

## Why did I create this?
The goal of this program is to help users evaluate the credibility of the information they come across online. While no system can perfectly determine whether a story is true or false, this tool aims to offer guidance by analyzing text for keywords and patterns commonly found in deceptive or misleading content. As language evolves and becomes more complex, this program may not catch everything, but it’s a step toward helping users become more critical readers.

## What does FakeInfoDetector do?

- Takes in information such as a article or link you might be skeptical about
- Runs that information through multiple systems 
- Detects if the information is real or fake by judging if there's keywords that will set it off
